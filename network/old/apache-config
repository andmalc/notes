Directives

binding
	Listen [IP]:<port>
		Specify which port(s) and if specified, addresses to listen on for
		incoming connections. If address not specified, will listen on all interfaces 

scope limiters
	limit scope of directives by enclosing in sections
	wildcards: *,?,[abc]
	...Match directives take regexs

	Filesystem space
		 <Directory>, <DirectoryMatch>, <Files>, <FilesMatch>, 
	Webspace - for non-filesystem resources only
		 <Location> <LocationMatch> 
			directives apply to a portion of the URL path
			e.g.
				<Location /thing>
					applies to requests for 
						<host>/thing
						<host>/thing123
						<host>/thing/subdir
	How sections merged
		Order: Directory, Files, Location
		If directives conflict/overlap, later ones take precedence
			 
mapping filesystem paths to locations
	Document Root directive
		sets '/' for requests
	paths outside of Document Root path
		filesytem symbolic links
			followed only if FollowSymLinks or SymLinksIfOwnerMatch in effect
		aliases
			<Alias location fs_path>
			ScriptAlias same + all content at target path treated as CGI scripts
		UserDirs
			if mod_userdir loaded and UserDir declaration, enables ~username access.
			default directory is ~/public_html (not user home dir)

content negotiation
	DirectoryIndex <default index.html>
		DrectoryIndex: sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory
		is requested.
		The index.html.var file (a type-map) is used to deliver content-
		negotiated documents.  The MultiViews Option can be used for the
		same purpose, but it is much slower.
		e.g.
			DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var
	type-maps
		files containing stanzas mapping files to content type preference
		requires
			AddHandler type-map .var
		suggests
			DirectoryIndex index.html.var

	MultiViews 
		allows alternate representations of a resource according to browser
		preferences (e.g. language) by choosing between files in a directory
		with common beginnings but differing ends

Options
	Indexes

Modules
	list compiled-in modules
		-l option
	load additional modules
		directive: LoadModule
		if checking presence of a loadable module with IfModule, its LoadModule
		directive must be first
		modules-available
			symlinks in modules-enabled point to .load (& .conf if available) files here
	mod_dir
		enables directory listings (which require a trailing '/') even if
		request doesn't include one
	mod_dav_fs - webdav
		see also Tortoise manual
			http://tinyurl.com/3rbm7
		requires
			Dav On (in a container)
			DavLockDB /var/lock/apache2/DAV
				(doesn't seem to be needed under Debian)
				directory must be writable by the Apache user & group
			apache user must have *full* permissions on fs directory

Home Directories
	UserDir <default public_html>
		enables mapping of ~username requests to a directory
		name of directory appended to response to ~username request

Virtual Hosts
	NameVirtualHost	IP#[:port] or *[:<port>] 
		Designates an IP address for name-virtual hosting
		usually just use '*'
	
	VirtualHost section with a address:port attribute matching the arg for NameVirtualHost 
		VirtualHost *

		essential configs:
			An IP address to bind to - can use fqn but IP# recommended
				really essential?
			ServerName - use fqn
			DocumentRoot <path with no final />

		example
			NameVirtual Host *
			<VirtualHost *>
				ServerName xx.com
				ServerAlias www.xx.com
				DocumentRoot /var/www
				<Directory *>
					stuff
				</Directory>
			</VirtualHost>

	UserDirs
		UserDir <dir name>
			makes dir available as ~<username> unless absolute path given
			make dir www-data readable
			'disable root' recommended
		cgi
			<Directory /home/*/cgi-bin/>
				Options ExecCGI
				SetHandler cgi-script
			</Directory>
		allow users to alter config
			AllowOverride to specify options changed in a .htaccess


CGI
	CGI processing done by builtin mod_cgi handler.  Files are handled if 
	identified as having type application/x-httpd-cgi.  Files aquire this type 
	if either:
	* are in a ScriptAlias directory.
	* have an extentsion defined by the AddType directive.  	

	To trigger execution of scripts based on filename extention:
		* 'Options +ExecCGI' must be set for the directory locations if outside
		'ScriptAlias' directory.
		* The AddHandler directive for the file extension must be set 
		e.g. 'AddHandler cgi-script cgi pl py'
		
	ON Unix, all CGI files are parsed for 'schebang' line ('#!cmd') at top
	of file.  Must give full path to executable.

	Environment
		server run as unprivilaged user (www, nobody)

		no $PATH in server env
	Related directives
		ScriptAlias <virtual location> <directory> 
			Designates a directory whose content is executed instead of being sent 
			to the client as a file
			ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/

Directives
	order of application
		1. Directories, shortest paths first
		2. Directories in Virtual Hosts
		3. Locations
		4. Files
	filesystem 
		these applied regardless of how request made e.g. case variations, from
		a script
		Directory <path>
			enclosed directives apply to path and subdirectories
		Files <filename pattern>
			enclosed directives apply to all matching files in any directory
	urls in requests
		Location <pat>
			applies when pat found anywhere in request URL
		Alias, SciptAlias <url> <path>
			map URL paths to special locations, usually outside DocumentRoot

Misc
	AllowOverride <directives>
		which directives may be redefined in a .htaccess file
		e.g
			AllowOverride Options
		would allow an .htaccess file
			Options +ExecCGI
	DirectoryIndex  
		Follow with a space-seperated list of file names that will be sent 
		when only the directory name is given in the URL. (e.g. index.html, 
		index.htm, default.html etc.)
	AddHandler vs. SetHandler - 
		1st takes file ext. arg and maps ext to a handler.  SetHandler sets 
		handler for all files in its context.
