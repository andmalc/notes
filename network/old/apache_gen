			e.g
				useradd -c "httpd owner" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -u httpd

		set permissions on content directories
			content owner:
				useradd -c "Web Server" -d /var/www/ -g web -s /bin/false -u web
			content editors:
				members of www-data, web etc. group
			content directories must be executable and readable by Apache user
				e.g. 775
			content files must be readable by Apache user
				e.g. 664
			parent directories must be executable by Apache user
				e.g. 701
			for public_html dirs in home directories
				home dirs 701
				public_html dirs 705
				content files 644
