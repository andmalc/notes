Hw setup options:

	1. Use softphone (X-Lite, or one of proprietary, such as Skype or
	VoipDiscount). Then WRT54GL is the only device that you need. You can
	optionally set up QoS on it - and you are all set. That will conclude your
	VoIP project, but doesn't make the router "a VoIP box". The drawbacks - you
	have to be near your computer with headsets/microphone and your computer
	must be on to send or receive calls. I think there are also some USB or
	BlueTooth phones that you can use with such setup.

	2. Use WRT54GL <==> ATA configuration. ATA is analog telephone adapter,
	such as Sipura/Linksys SPA. That's the setup that I am using - suites my
	needs perfectly. Or, you can use  Router/ATA combo such as the one that you
	linked to.

	3. Have some SIP or Asterisk client running on a router, and USB/BT as
	interface to a BT phone. OpenWRT comes with OpenSER and Asterisk, so if you
	go for it - share your experience. I haven't seen anybody running such
	configuration, so I was afraid to be the first to try. There are a few
	routers with USB port, such as Asus models or Linksys WRTSL54GS

ENUM RFC 3761 is a protocol the uses the Internet DNS system to
