Startup Process {{{2

Xsession man page: http://www.wlug.org.nz/Xsession%285%29

Main server process either XSession or ? (depends on display manager settings)
Configure startup process other than XSession:
	xdm: edit xdm/xdm-config
	startx:	xinit/xinitrc

XSession
	XSession not started by user but wthin environment set up by any of: 
	startx, xdm, xinit, or a display manager.
	Arguments: failsafe, default, or program
		program
			- ignored if no Xsession.options files is present
			- usually is name of window manager (in $PATH)
	Confirms existance of script dir Xsession.d and sources scripts there.  
	These files determine:
		- argument processing
		- resource merging
		- startup programs - e.g. client to launch as controlling process
			- use program arg
			- elif run script '.[Xx]session' to start initial clients if in 
			option in Xsession.options.
			- elif look for first of /usr/bin/x-session-manager, 
			/usr/bin/x-window-manager, or /usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator
			- else abort with error
		- starting ssh-agent if specified in Xsession.options
		- exec'ing X session in shell or within ssh-agent


xinit	
	- run by startx with client & server args:
		xinit [ [ client ] options ] [ - [server] [display] options]
	- Used instead of xdm for systems requiring more flexibility.
	- Loads resoures, starts clients, calls global Xsession script 
	- Needs client to start system specified either on command line or in 
	.xinitrc or (last choice) /usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.

	.xinitrc script permissions: must be 700
		see examples for this & .xsession in xfree86-common doc dir
		format:
			# Startup X stuff
			exec client &
			[exec] wm

Xsession.options
	option defaults?
	options
		use-ssh-agent
			if ssh-agent is avail and no agent process is running, invoke X session by exec'ing ssh-agent with the startup command.
		allow-user-xsession
			use .xsession startup script in user home dir.  Invoke with 'sh' 
			if file not executable.
			- default is no


Run 2nd X session under different user
	switch to console Ctrl+Alt+F1
	login as other user
	startx -- :1
	switch to Ctrl+Alt+F8
	or under gnome 2.4, 'new login' under application/system tools

XServer Config {{{2

	xorg.conf file (cf XF86config - older config utility)
		Options: case insensitive, values must be quoted, no value = "on"
	xf86cfg     newer graphical configuration


xset
	temporarily set various user preference settings: dpms options, font path, 
	mouse settings etc.
	'xset q' - display all setttings


X11 Fonts {{{2

	X servers can obtain fonts from directories in file system (local to server), font servers (from network location), or both.
	standard location for fonts: /usr/share/fonts
	standard renderer is freetype2
		used by all KDE and GTK2/Gnome apps using fontconfig
		provides apps with antialiasing, autohinting and sub-pixel rendering

	fontconfig 
		provides listing/matching
		config: dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config or by changing links in /etc/fonts/conf.d

	outline vs. bitmapped fonts
		outline preferred, size is scalable
