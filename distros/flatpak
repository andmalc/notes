Sandbox permissions {{{1
https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/sandbox-permissions.html

Two dirs writable by default
	App's user data: ~/.var/app
	Runtime dir: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (/run/user/<user id>)

persist=path option 
	- can be used to map paths from the userâ€™s home directory into the sandbox filesystem and that do not need to be visible. 
	- this makes it possible to avoid configuring access to the entire home directory, and can be useful for applications that hardcode file paths in ~/.
	- eg. ~/.mozilla => ~/.var/app/mozilla

filesystem=path optio
	-  is for granting access to stuff that is either outside the user's home directory or they do need to see in their file manager, like ~/Documents


Firefox profile: 
	var/home/andmalc/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox/<profile dir>



Runtimes in /var/lib/flatpak/runtimes
	derived runtimes use hard links to source to save space
	use 'du -hs' to see space used
