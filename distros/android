Filesystem {{{1

fs is ext4 so cannot be mounted by Windows
MTP is newer protocol and used instead.

/               root fs
/sdcard         shortcut to /data/media/0
/data           ext4 partition
                caches & misc sys folders
/data/media     TW backups
/data/media/0   0 is first Android user, 10 is next
                apps folders, Downloads, Pictures 
                Removed by stock factory reset
                
                
Factory reset 
from within custom ROM is done by TW
Normaly only wipe needed
/data/media preserved by standard TW wipe unless 'Format Data' 
wipes caches too
Do when switching ROMs but not when upgrading


Backups
Default options: system, data, and boot
Also backup efs or System Image if avaiable for complete system restore, e.g. return to stock, but do not restore these unless known necessary as risk of bricking.
