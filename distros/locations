$WAYLAND_DISPLAY
	This tells Wayland clients which Wayland compositor to connect to. 
	Normally the name of a socket in XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and set to 1 or 0.
	e.g. $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-* 

XDG dirs
	https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_user_directories
	read from ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs
	set with xdg-user-dirs-update -set <dir, e.g. DOWNLOAD>
		list of valid dir names in man page

	XDG_DATA_HOME
		base directory relative to which user-specific data files should be stored
		$HOME/.local/share/.

	XDG_DATA_DIRS
		preference-ordered set of base directories, separated by colons (':'), to search for data files in addition to the XDG_DATA_HOME base directory. 
		If not set or empty, assumed to be /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/.

	XDG_CONFIG_HOME
		The base directory relative to which user-specific configuration files should be stored. 
		If not set, or empty, assumed to be $HOME/.config/.

	XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
		The preference-ordered set of base directories, separated by colons (':'), to search for configuration files in addition to the XDG_CONFIG_HOME base directory. 
		If not set or empty, assumed to be /etc/xdg/.

	XDG_STATE_HOME
		the base directory relative to which user-specific state files should be stored, containing data that should persist between (application) restarts, but that is not important or portable enough to the user that it should be stored in XDG_DATA_HOME. 
		If not set, or empty, assumed to be $HOME/.local/state/.

	XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
		the base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential runtime files and other file objects (such as sockets, named pipes, ...) should be stored. The directory MUST be owned by the user, who MUST be the only one having read and write access to it; its permissions MUST be 0700.
		/run/user/<user id>

	$XDG_CACHE_HOME
		the base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential data files should be stored. 
		If not set or empty, assumed to be $HOME/.cache/.
		not set on Fedora WS or SB
		maybe not relevant to flatpaks as per app location is $HOME/.var/app/*/cache
