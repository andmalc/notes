udev package
	udev is a program which dynamically creates and removes device
	nodes from /dev/. It responds to /sbin/hotplug device events and
	requires a 2.6 kernel.

udevadm
	monitor - monitor events
		--udev --property	Verbose device info
		get /sys path here

	trigger --action=add --verbose --subsystem-match=XXX 
		causes reread of rules
		may be needed even after reboot

	control --reload-rules 
		said does not work for existing devices

	test </sys path>

Device Info
	udevadm info --attribute-walk --path=/sys/class/net/usbpn0

Rules format
	HAL fdi files > Udev .rules
	Format is changed:

udev monitors sysfs and creates nodes only as exported thr sysfs
can write rules to make device names consistant, even after reboot
devfs obsoleted by udev
unlike older devfs, doesn't load modules
