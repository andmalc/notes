Terms {{{1

Repo is set of the current and past commits

Staging Index 
    composed by git add/git read-tree
    staging area for new commit and becomes the new commit
    created at checkout, updated by add command
    includes snapshot of all files, not just staged.
    new blob created for added/modified files 

Commit:
    pointer to a top level tree obj created by snapshotting Index 
        as well as commiter info & other metadata
    author & commiter info
    commit message
    except for first 'root' commit, stores zero or more pointers to parent commits

Commit ID
    SHA-1 checksum of the commitâ€™s contents

    relative references to a commit ID: ~#
        ~1  one commit before current


Refs
    Simple - points to commit ID
    Symbolic - points to another ref

Branch
    movable pointer (simple ref) to tip (newest) commit of collection of commits
    branch moved forward on each commit

    Master      default name of first branch

HEAD        
    Normally symbolic ref to /refs/heads/<branch name> which normally refers to 
        tip (last commit) of current local branch.  
    This defines which branch is on
    When committing, HEAD is set as parent commit
    If earlier commit checked out, is hard link to commit ID.
    Then in detached HEAD mode, not on branch

    Detatched if is simple ref.
    Checking out branch moves this pointer.  

Tags
    lightweight
        Like commit object but ref to commits, not trees.
        Unlike branch refs never change
    annotated
        Can ref to any object, not just commits
        -m field can hold any data

Checkout cid
    Change the HEAD symref to point to the new  branch 
    Reset the index to match the tip of the new branch 
    If branch given, modified files in working dir retained unless forced -f 
    If no branch name, update the working tree to match the index

origin      
    default name of remote repo
    remote branches locally referred to as origin/branch_name
    Can then c/o with 'co <name>'.  Remote is 'upstream'
    origin/master = refs/remotes/origin/master


Remote 
    like a bookmark for a repository


Merge commits  multiple parents


Repos {{{1

Example: create new repo with remote at BB
	git init <dir>
	git add . 
	git commit -m 'comment'
	git remote add bb ssh://git@bitbucket.org/andmalc/work.git
	git push --all bb # pushes up the repo and its refs for the first time

	git commit -a  #all changes in working directory
	git push -u origin master

remote 
    -v          show origin details
    add         <remote add <name> <url>
    fetch		pull remote changes to remote tracking branch
    clone		create local repo, remote tracking branch auto-created
    pull		pull remote changes to remote tracking branch 
                    and start merge = fetch+merge
    set-url <name> <new URL>
    push <repo> upload changes to remote.  Default repo is origin
                <local branch name>:<remote name>

Set new remote
     remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git


Info {{{1

Status {{{2

Shows changes to tracked files and presence of untracked files in working dir

-sb	
	short form
	Red is changed or untracked
	Green is staged

Diff {{{2

Changes to file contents

no arg			changes to tracked files not staged
				i.e. changes between working tree and index
--cached cid	changes in index relative to cid
--staged		same as --cached

HEAD        	changed + staged vs. current commit
cid             changes to tracked + newly tracked vs. cid
cid cid         changes to tracked + newly tracked vs. cid
HEAD\^ HEAD	show diffs between last two commits.  Prefix noglob in zsh for no ^ escape needed
    
diff for single file
cid fn
origin/master:./ -- <filename>
A1234B:./ -- <filename> 

log {{{2

    Commit history 
    current branch including ancestors from other branches
    does not show commits not part of a branch unless specified with --stat

    args
         <path>			show commits to this file only

    options:
         --stat <cid>   specific commit
        --all           show other branches too
        --decorate      show branch names
        -#				number of commits to show
         --oneline

    filter:
         --grep         grep commit messge

     file info:
         -p				show diffs	

	 --decorate --graph --oneline --all

ls-files {{{2

    Shows tracked files 

    --abbrv --stage/-s     Show index with abbreviated object name

other info {{{2

ls-remote
    show remote commit

show [cid]
    show last changes or in cid 

difftool			show diff in vim etc.

grep
    Ignores according to .gitignore



Add & Commit {{{1


add <path spec>
    creates snapshot of file which is later used by commit
    -i  interactive
    -n  dry run
    -p  stage subsections of a file
    -A/--all   updates index to match entire working tree. Includes untracked files.

commit 
    -v	show diff in commit message

    -a  commits all staged and changed tracked files including deletes
        bypasses staging, untracked files excluded
                

Reverting / Resetting {{{1

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes

revert <commit>
    generate a new commit that undoes changes in <commit> 
    applies that to the current branch.    
    Preferred over Reset because preserves history

    revert HEAD~1
        new commit undoing changes from last commit


Reset
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-reset

no arg
	Unstages chnages in Index, no effect on files
	Implies --mixed HEAD

<file>
	Unstages a file

--mixed
	Reset Index but not working tree
	
--hard [<commit>]
	Reset the index and changes to working tree

--soft HEAD~1
	Commit is removed from branch
	HEAD points to previous commit
	Preserves Index and working tree changes
	No action if <commit> not specified

Undo last commit, preserving local changes in index
git reset --mixed HEAD~1

# Move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}
git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"
    Undo non-pushed commits
        git reset origin/master
    Reset to remote state
        git fetch origin
        git reset --hard origin/master

#Reset remote (e.g. on GitHub)
--hard origin -f


Branches {{{1


branch 
    -v  show all branches,  most recent commit
    -r	show remote tracking branches
    -a	show local and remote tracking branches
    -d  delete <branch>
    -rd delete remote <remote>/<branch>
    -m	rename

    create new branch from current or other commit, don't switch to it	    	   
        <branch name> [cid]	

    create new branch <name> and switch to it
        git switch -c <new branch name>

    create new branch <name> based on other branch and switch to it
        checkout -b <new branch name> <source branch name>	

    create new branch tracking remote and switch to it
        checkout -b <name> origin/name


Set upstream branch
    branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master
    branch -b <branchname> --track origin/<remote b name>
    push --set-upstream origin gh-pages (confirmed works)

Change remote branch name or create (?)
    git push origin <branch>

show-branch show all changes in branch

git symbolic-ref HEAD


Submodules & Subtrees {{{1

Tracked in .gitmodules file.  Composed from a gitlink tree entry in main repo that points to particular commit 

Add
    submodule add [--name name] <repo URL> [relative path in parent repo]
    if path given, logical name is tail unless --name specified
    if no local name given, repo cloned into cwd/<final part of repo path>

    Info added to:
        .git/config
    Creates 
        .gitmodules 
            used by init when repo is cloned to populate .git/config
        .git/modules/<path to submodule> 
            this is location of submodule's git repo
            referenced by gitdir file in sm root.


Include submodule contents on initial clone
    git clone repo --recursive

    if forgot --recursive
        git submodule init
            update .gitconfig with info from .gitmodules
        git submodule update
            pull files and create entry in .git/modules
    or
        git submodule update --init


Delete
    git rm -r  <path to submodule>
        Note: no trailing slash after submodule name
    git commit -a -m 'removed submodule ... '

 
    # or, if you want to leave it in your working tree
    git rm --cached asubmodule
    mv asubmodule_tmp asubmodule
    rm -rf .git/modules/asubmodule


Updating
    cd into module dir
    git pull origin master
