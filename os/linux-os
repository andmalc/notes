OS concepts {{{1

Processes
    all have environments - set of key/value mappings
    normally a new process is forked from parent and inherits environment
	associated with program code which is loaded from disk


Sockets
    Socket is the API's abstraction for a IP-port pair. It handles the network and transfer layer of communication. It can be thought of as a application's interface to the network.


System Info utils {{{1

conky
	shows memory, cpu, filesystem usage

uname - processor type, kernel type etc

kernel boot messages
    dmesg	

process info
	top/htop
	pstree

control groups
	systemd-cgtop - resource usage
	systemd-cgls - view as a tree

Virtual Memory
    view all memory usage with 'cat /proc/meminfo'

lspci
    cat /proc/pc
    lsusb
    lscpu
    lsmod
        cat /proc/modules

Find device number for /sys
	first column of output of lsusb.py -i
	locate in /sys e.g.
		/sys/bus/usb/devices/...
	run realpath to get link origin

Processes {{{1

ps  process snapshot 
    Processes in [[ ]] have been swaped out due to inactivity
    Status Codes: S - sleeping, R - running

    axfww   show process tree 
    -ef     flat output for greping

Environment
    env     show or set shell environment

    Env for a command 
    prep <cmd> => PID
    cat /proc/PID/environ  | tr '\0' '\n'


procfs {{{1

Process namespaces 
	http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/mount.2.html
	
	set of file system mounts that are visible to a process
	changes in one process affect all others
	/proc/PID/self file exposes the list of mount points in the
       mount namespace of the process with the specified ID
	after fork, child process shares parent's namespace
	after clone, child gets private copy

http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man5/proc.5.html

Kernel exports info to user space via virtual filesystem
Files can be read and given permissions but do not exist on disk	
Files usually read-only

/proc filesystem
    process information pseudo-file system
    runtime info about system memory, devices mounted, hardware 

process info
    proc/PID/cmdline, cwd, environ etc.


sysfs/sysctl {{{1
originally mounted at /proc/sys
installed with procps package
Kernel config: General Setup = Sysctl support
sysctl migrating to write to sysfs
