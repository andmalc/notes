Path Specification

Ignoring Paths
http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/info/apps/unison.hints

Preferences taking path pattern values:
ignore/ignorenot, follow, sortfirst/sortlast, backup

3 Path value formats:
Regex <regexp>  Posix extended regex (no character classes).  Must match whole path
Name <name>  matches any path in which the last component matches name
Path <path> matchs absolute (relative to root of replica) path

Name & Path use shell globbing matching:
# a ? matches any single character except /
# a * matches any sequence of characters not including /
# [xyz] matches any character from the set {x, y, z }
# {a,bb,ccc} matches any one of a, bb, or ccc.

Directory separator in paths is always '/'.  In roots it is os-dependent.

If a directory is ignored, so will all its descendents.

Unison & Keychain
------------------
Invoke unison with following script:

@echo off
call bash --login /dev/null
call C:\Cygwin\home\kmoerder\ssh-agent.cmd
unison

The call to bash invokes the keychain in the .profile to get the keys ready then the call to ssh-agent.cmd defines the env variables for non-cygwin ssh-aware programs (such as unison).

Specify location of server-side unison executable in profile:
servercmd=<path>
