Procedures
---------
copy your cd into an image file:
    dd if=/dev/cdrom of=RedHat60.img
verify copied image
    Method 1: compare sums:
        sum -r /dev/cdrom
        sum -r RedHat60.img
    Method 2: compare checksums:
        cksum /dev/cdrom
        cksum RedHat60.img
    Method 3: compare contents manually
        mount /mnt/cdrom
        mkdir /tmp/RH60CD
        mount -t iso9660 RedHat60.img /tmp/RH60CD -o loop
        diff -r /tmp/RH60CD /mnt/cdrom
        Broken links indicated with 'target not found'

make a permanent mount point for an image on disk
    iso.img /home/ftp/pub/distro/i386 iso9660 defaults,loop,ro   0 0

Make a new image from disk contents
    cd_dir will be root of CD   
    mkisofs options -o filename.iso cd_dir [cd_dir]     or
    mkisofs options cd_dir > filename.iso

        -f follow symbolic links in src
        -graph-points - graft paths at points other than at root directory
            foo/bar=../file
            foo/bar=/a/dir/somewhere
        -M <path>   Merge to an existing iso file
        -M <SCSI device> Merge to cdrom (see man page)
        -o <file>   Output file name
        -path-list <file>   list of paths to include
        -x path  - exclude path (can use globbing)

Remaster/alter an iso
    mount -o loop -t iso9660 iso dir
    cp -a dir/* someotherdir
    <do something>
    mkisofs -pad -l -r -J -v -V "gnoppix" -b CREDATIV/boot.img -c CREDATIV/boot.cat -hide-rr-moved -o gnoppix-0.5.4-1-en.iso /somewhere_else

DVDs
        utils
                regionselect
    regionset - view and modify the region code of DVD drives
    Regionset is a small utility which displays and sets the
    region/zone setting of a DVD drive, allowing it to decrypt the
    DVD's sold in this geographical zone. Hardware vendors often limit
    the number of such modifications, but it is necessary to set it at
    least once with a brand new drive.
