Attributes {{{1

ownership
    user & users imply noexec, nosuid, & nodev unless subsequently
    overriden 
        e.g. -o user[s],exec,suid
    "auto, uid=500, gid=100" 
        take all ownership of files in mounted partition.


Stickiness
	Files 
		executable & sharable file which is not immediately discarded from swap 
			after execution.  Only root can create.
	Directories "+t"
		only file owner and write or delete
		used in common directories when write access granted thr. group

setuid & setguid
	Files
		setuid	
			Set-user-on-execution bits
			eg chmod +s ...  => -rwsr-xr-x
	Directory "g+s"
		setguid	
			all files created in dir have group of dir
				1. change dir ownership to group
				2. set group write permissions on dir
				3. chmod g+s or leading 2, chmod 2xxx
			file moved in not affected, files copied are
    
File & Dir Permissions {{{1

File Permissions
    r 4  read
    w 2  write
    x 1  execute
	X	execute only if a dir or already executable
    t   executable and sticky
    T   sticky but not executable
    s   setuid or setguid and executable
    S   setuid or setguid but not executable

Directory Permissions
    r	show files in directory listing
    w	change directory contents
    x	access by name (executable, as in access with a program)
		this permission sufficient to 'see through' if path known
    t   sticky
    s   setuid and guid
		set guid: sudo chmod g=rxs <dir>

restricting access
	in /home - chmod * 700. No need for restrictive permissions on subdirs
	in adduser.conf
		DIR_MODE=700


Mode Octal {{{1

Modes are absolute (using octal numbering) or symbolic

File
	600		personal
	644, 664	readonly for group or world

Directory 
	700		personal
	750		group read
	775		group access, world read
	701		others can execute dirs but not read in them, 
			ie could do a listing further in
			- this might be for a personal dir with a public_html subdir

Special modes
    4000    set user ID on execution
    2000    set group ID on execution
    1000    sticky bit
umask	restricts access - subtracted from default mode

Groups: 
    Password file contains entry (at end of line) for user's default group.  
    Additional group membership in groups file.

Links {{{1

ln -s or cp -s <original> <link>
	For original and link in different dirs, cd to link dir first.
		cp -s ../dir/file .
