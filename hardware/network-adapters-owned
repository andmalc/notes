Tips
http://binarywolf.com/249/connectors.htm

It's important to make sure you have compatible connectors on your card,
pigtail and antenna. The wireless card connectors are usually u.fl (or I-PEX),
MMCX or MCX. The antenna connectors are generally of type N, SMA or TNC.
Connectors can also be male or female (you need a matching pair) and straight
or reverse polarity (you need the same polarity). All of our wireless cards
have u.fl compatible connectors and our pigtails and antennas are either N-type
or reverse SMA.

	u.fl
	MC, MMCX

Antenna connectors (largest > smallest)
	reverse polarity models have female center pin
	N-type
		for outdoor antennas, larger - male about 2 cm
		antenna is male side (?)
		- N-Type Male has threads on the inside with a solid (male) center pin. This is the connector to use to mate with most outdoor antennas and access points.

	bought 4/08
	Antenna connect single MMCX
	driver at:
		http://ubnt.com/support/xr2.php

	Antenna will be 'B' in software
	Avoid using without an antenna
	Said to work well: 18 volts 800ma power adapter with POE
	Most important to use grounding cable with omni antennas as most do not have DC grounding


Compex WLM54 200mW 802.11b/g miniPCI
	part WLM54GP23 but WLM54G23 on company site
	chipset Atheros AR2413
	connector U.FL 
		probably as shown here http://www.mini-box.com/s.nl/it.A/id.460/.f
		on board is U.FL
		adapter other end N-type female, Straight (RSMA?), 
		antenna will be N-type male

2.4 GHz

5 GHz
said: NS5 will have more bandwidth and less interference
Could do distance with this and network cable to uplink port of home router
