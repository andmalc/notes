Program types {{{1
- Filters
    Take arbitrary input from file or stdin and usually modify and output same data
    e.g. grep, sort, sed, awk
    Historically took data via keyboard ?

-   Others
    Take data of specific types as input. Output data is not related.
    May not take data on stdin.  Only recognize command line args (argv)
    eg. rm, kill

cat - concatenate files
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29#Useless_use_of_cat
    defaults to reading from and outputing to terminal
    cat file1 file2 > targetfile
    cat > targetfile # type in lines below, end with c+d



Programs {{{1

Filters {{{2

awk

cut
    extract input on tabs into fields
    fields: #,# or #-#
    -f #-# field or fields to extract
    -d  delimiter instead of tabs
    -c  select character range by position

grep

head/tail
    output last ten lines
    -n #    last # lines
    -n +#   ten lines starting at line #

    15 lines starting at 100
        head -n 100 | tail -n 15

diff 
diff file1 file2
    Show how to change file1 to match file2

    Options
        -c      context
        -u      show changed lines together

    tutorial in Unix Power Tools
    sdiff   show diffs in columns


cmp     show info in common

column  display output in columns

comm    shows unique and common lines in sorted lists

less
    -S  do not wrap long lines.  Can page sideways with l/r arrows

paste f1 f2
    combine contents of files into columns
    
Sort	Sorts by fields, from left to right
    sort by column two
        sort -k 2 <file>
    sort by column two then by column one
        sort -k2,2 -k1,1 <file>
    Plus other sorting types


	+<n>	Sort on field n (zero-based, from left)
	-<n>	Don't sort on field n

	-n	specify numbic sort on field

tee
    read from standard input and write to standard output and files
    -a  append

    seq -f "Line %g" 10 | tee lines

tr
    translate characters

    -s <char>   squeeze repeats (remove duplicate chars)
     : '\n'     #convert colans to line breaks
     '[:space:]' '--'
     '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
     
uniq
    find adjacent repeated lines 
    sort input list to find all dups
    -c  print count of occurances
    -d  print dups only
    -c  print unique only

wc - counting
    -l      lines in file
            read lines in piped input, e.g. ls -l | wc -l 


Example:

Find most common words:
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | grep -oE '\w+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr  | head -n 30

Filter lines
    start at line number
        tail -n +4
    remove lines
         < lines sed  '1,3d'
          < lines sed -n '1,3!p'
    subset of lines
        sed -n '4,6p'
        -n 6 | tail -n 3
    every other line
        sed -n '1~2p'
    by pattern
        grep -E <regex> 

Edit lines
    tr - replace or delete 
    sed
