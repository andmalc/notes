# Asciidoc Notes

## Doc Structure {{{1

Doc is top level block containing a sequence of blocks, an optional preamble, and an optional non-block header containing metadata attributes.

## Elements aka Block Types {{{1

Elements are a hierarchy of types, where one element may be a specialization of a family of elements.

Element Types:
* Position:
** Block - stacked vetically
** Inline - span of content
*** Found in:
**** a block
**** a block attribute (e.g. block title

//-


# Delimited Blocks {{{1

Defined using structural containers, which are the fixed set of recognized block enclosures in the AsciiDoc syntax.

Indicate using delimiters aka fences - four or more repeating characters on a line by themselves to mark the boundary of the block. The one exception is the open block, which only requires two - repeating characters.  Deliminators follow metadata.

Block styles
	indicate as an attr
		[listing]
		blah blah


## Block titles {{{2

Indicate:
	single dot immediately before text

Location:
	own line above attr list, opening delimiter, or content

## Block IDs {{{2

indicate:
	shorthand:	[id=my-id]
	longhand:	[#my-id]
	inline:		[#my-id]#Blah blah#
	legacy syntax:	[[my-id]]

if period in ID use long-hand syntax

Directly follows style name if used in attr list
	[quote#my-id]

Block types {{{2
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/blocks/build-basic-block/

Undelimited blocks, e.g. ordinary paragraph
	No indication
	Content must be contiguous - empty line starts a new block
	Can still add a title or attr list


Literal blocks
- background optionally styled
- Indicate:
	set 'literal' style
	enclose with '....'
	single line: begin with one or more spaces.  Spaces do not show in output


Listing blocks
- preformatted text <pre>
- good for computer code
 - usually styled with grey background
 Indicate:
        enclose within '----'
        set 'listing' style on block within attribute list
        single line: begin with one or more spaces

Example block
- styled background + caption above
Indicate:
    enclose within "===="
    caption line starts with period
    caption prefixed with "Example #" - override with [caption=""] attribute above

Open blocks
- indicate:
    enclose within "--"
- can use to include text within a list:

        * list item
        +
        --
        include::shared-content.adoc[]
        --
- enclose a nested list
Enclose in open block - https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/lists/continuation/#multiline-principal-text

Passthroughs
- Unprocessed content that is sent directly to the output
- indicate: `++++` or [pass]



## Attributes {{{1
----
:myvar: value here.
----

Value is: {myvar}.

- positional (value only)
- named (key/value)

Reserved attributes
- core set: shared by all blocks & some inline elements, e.g. id, role, title
- additional used by some elements, e.g. source block has lang attr.

Typical element attr uses: define ID, enable or configure its features, apply user-defined info, apply roles


Attr Lists:

List format:
	positional,named="value",etc.
	[first-positional,second-positional,named="value of named"]

Location
	line of text above start of block

syntax
	block:  enclosed in [ ]
	macro: name::target[attr1,att2]

	formatted text: [#idname.rolename]*text with id and role*

## Roles {{{2

Indicate:
	shorthand: .

Options {{{2

Indicate:
	shorthand: %



# Formatting {{{1

Hard return: "+" at line end


From outer to innermost:

	Monospaced text
		shorthand: `text`, ``text``
		literal codespan/monospace (to escape special chars) `+text*text+` 

	Bold
		*text*, **text** 

	Italic
		_text_, __text__


Text Span
- use role to format inline text
- indicate: single or double hashes `[.underline]#underline me#`



# Lists {{{1

bulleted, numbered, labeled, callouts

Bulleted
- indicate with one to five dashs or asterisks. Asterisks preferred for nested lists.

Numbered
- indicate with number 1. or just period or roman numeral + ")"

Labelled
- indicate with term + "::"
- following para is indented
- [horizontal] attribute above for hanging indent, ie label and first para of list text on same line

List continuation - make following blocks part of list
indicate with newline starting with +
not needed when changing list types, e.g. numbered to bulleted

End of list marker: `//-`


Nesting lists:

Directives {{{1

Include
  include::shared-content.adoc[]



Cross-references {{{1
    target
        ID of section, heading, blocks, or inline anchors
            anchor IDs are auto-generated for section titles: _section_title
            before title: [#myid]

    syntax:
        full version (usually for interdoc refs).  File extension is optional:
            xref:filename.adoc#_ref_id[Reftext]
        shorthand
            <<anchor ID,reftext>>
            <<filename#anchor ID,reftext>>

	block - two colons ::
	inline - one colon :
